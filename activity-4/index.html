            Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the core -
            a tool you can customize to do anything.

            <p>Atom is the best editor ever, much better than brackets! Thanos snapped his fingers to specifically remove Brackets from existence :)</p>

            <h3>Elizabeth L.</h3>
            <p>Atom is not as user friendly as I thought it would have been. Also, they should rename it to Ant-Man, it is obviously a superior name.</p>

            <h3>Khris M.</h3>
            <p>Atom is okay, but I was more comfortable with using Brackets, comparing Atom to Brackets is like comparing Emid to Giannis...one is a 2x MVP and the other can't even get a date w/ Rihanna :D</p>
